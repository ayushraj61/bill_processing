# Database and Timezone Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Expired Google OAuth Token
**Problem:** Token had expired/been revoked causing authentication errors.
**Solution:** Deleted `token.pickle` file. The app will now prompt for re-authentication on next access.

### 2. ❌ Static File Path Mismatch
**Problem:** Template referenced `/static/background_dashboard.jpg` but file was `background_dashboard.jpeg`
**Solution:** Updated `templates/home.html` to use correct `.jpeg` extension.

### 3. ❌ Timezone-Naive/Aware Datetime Mismatch
**Problem:** Mixing timezone-naive (`datetime.utcnow()`) and timezone-aware datetimes causing database errors.
**Solution:** 
- Added `timezone` import to `main.py`
- Replaced all `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Updated database schema to use `DateTime(timezone=True)` for both `bills` and `bpoil` tables

### 4. ❌ Primary Key Violation in bpoil Table
**Problem:** Multiple line items were being inserted with the same `id` (String primary key), causing conflicts.
**Solution:**
- Changed `bpoil.id` from `String` (primary key) to `Integer` (autoincrement primary key)
- Added `drive_file_id` column to store Google Drive file ID reference
- Updated all INSERT statements to remove manual `id` assignment
- Updated all SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE queries to use `drive_file_id` instead of `id`

## Files Modified

### `/Users/ayushraj/FAST_API2 2/main.py`
- Added `timezone` import
- Changed `bills` table: `upload_date` → `DateTime(timezone=True)`
- Changed `bpoil` table schema:
  - `id`: `String` → `Integer` (autoincrement, primary key)
  - `upload_date`: `DateTime` → `DateTime(timezone=True)`
  - Uses `drive_file_id` to reference Google Drive files
- Updated all datetime operations to use timezone-aware objects
- Fixed all bpoil INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries to use new schema

### `/Users/ayushraj/FAST_API2 2/templates/home.html`
- Fixed background image path: `background_dashboard.jpg` → `background_dashboard.jpeg`

### `/Users/ayushraj/FAST_API2 2/migrate_database.py` (NEW)
- Created migration script to update existing database
- Successfully migrated data from old schema to new schema
- **Already executed successfully ✅**

## Database Schema Changes

### Before:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bpoil (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,  -- ❌ Caused duplicate key violations
    drive_file_id VARCHAR,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP,   -- ❌ Not timezone-aware
    ...
);
```

### After:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bpoil (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- ✅ Auto-increment
    drive_file_id VARCHAR,           -- ✅ References Google Drive file
    upload_date TIMESTAMPTZ,         -- ✅ Timezone-aware
    ...
);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Re-authenticate with Google (delete token.pickle was already done)
- [ ] Test uploading a new bill
- [ ] Test processing bills from Google Drive
- [ ] Verify line items are properly stored in bpoil table
- [ ] Test approve workflow
- [ ] Test rescan functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your FastAPI server** to pick up the schema changes
2. **Re-authenticate with Google** when prompted (browser will open)
3. **Test file upload/processing** to ensure datetime errors are resolved

## Notes

- Migration script has already been run successfully ✅
- Old data was preserved and migrated to new schema
- All timezone-aware datetime objects now use UTC
- Multiple line items per bill are now properly supported in bpoil table
