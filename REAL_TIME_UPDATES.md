   - Shows all existing bills from database
   
2. **Background processing starts** 🔄

   - Processes them one by one
   
3. **Visual notification appears** 🟢
   - Green banner in top-right corner
   - Shows: "Processing bills: 2/10 - filename.pdf"
   - Browser tab title updates: "[2/10] Processing Bills..."
   
4. **Auto-refresh when complete** 🔄
   - When all files are processed
   - Dashboard automatically reloads after 1 second
   - New bills appear without you doing anything!
